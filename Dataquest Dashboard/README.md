Task: 

Dataquest wasasked by leadership to explore trends and discover insights related to the conversion funnel. 
Specifically, they'd like to see which marketing channels, locations, 
and customer personas are most valuable, from both overall volume and conversion rate perspectives. 
They've asked that we create a dashboard that shows some insights and allows them to explore the data for themselves.

Objectives of this project:

- Build data visualizations in Tableau using best practices.
- Create Tableau dashboards.
- Add dashboard actions and filters to allow for data discovery.
- Add annotations and highlighting to call out key insights.

Future Work:

Expanding on project either by improving the current dashboard or creating additional dashboards to show more insights. Some ideas include: 
- Organizing the country list into regions to better visualize location data.
- Adding additional actions and filters to make the dashboard more interactive.
- Creating individual dashboards to focus on conversion, sign-ups, and subscriptions.
